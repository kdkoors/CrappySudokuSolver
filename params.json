Written in the middle of the night during mission support. It contains a terrible circular reference between the Cell and Group classes. And the build process is, uh, unique. You will notice that the \"main\" source file, sudo.C does the #includes of not the header files but the C source files themselves. This is all due to the funky circular reference.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you have an even remotely recent copy of the GNU C++ compliler it should build with a simple 'g++ -I . sudo.C'\r\n\r\nI promise to make it better at some point. \r\n\r\nKen Koors\r\nken.koors@gmail.com\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
